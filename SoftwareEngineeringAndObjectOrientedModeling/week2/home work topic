Week2.java.lists:

    Look at how object-oriented programming has been used to code different list implementations.

    Look at tests and how JUnit testing is written (we discussed it in the classroom).

    Look at perfs and how the different performance numbers are collected.
    Try to understand the two performance evaluation tests

        package edu.ujf.perfs.utils
        -> class TestA and TestB.

    You can run the performance tests via run.sh
    Try to make sense of the performance number you see.
    You can compare these numbers with the numbers obtained with Week1.c.lists

Week2.Echo:

    Step1 Folder:
         The code is about several steps (1 to 6) reading from a character stream and printing.
         The different versions of the code show you different bugs.
         The last version (6) is the correct one.

    Step2 Folder:
        Read and understand the various classes.
        This is about introducing modularity and object-oriented programming.
        THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT AS WE WILL BUILD ON THIS NEXT WEEK.
