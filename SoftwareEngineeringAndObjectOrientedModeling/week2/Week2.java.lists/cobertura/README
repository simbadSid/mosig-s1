This is the readme for using corbertura to generate both test and coverage
reports for our project. 

Notice:

1) that we drive cobertura through ant, 
   mostly because we found it difficult to drive it directly from a shell script.

2) we rely on JUnit tests for coverage.
   the test classes must be name like "Testxyz", such as TestA and TestB for example.

3) look in build.properties
   notice the "from.xyz" properties that tell where your sources and your tests are.
